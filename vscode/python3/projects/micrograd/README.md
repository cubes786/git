## Project Overview

This project is adapted from Andrej Karpathy's original implementation, which he presented in his YouTube video: [Building an LLM from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0). I owe my foundational understanding of LLM (Large Language Model) training to his incredible work. Hats off to Andrej Karpathy for his contribution!


## My Contribution

I have added label and color coding to the `Value` class to make the final result more intuitive, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the gradient logic and backpropagation processes. This enhancement aims to visually clarify the data flow and computations within the model, making it easier for learners to grasp the concepts.
